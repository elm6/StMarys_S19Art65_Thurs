            <p>Today was the first day of class. We learned basic HTML coding using tutorials on the W3schools website (attached below). I created my first HTML file and worked to enter tags and change the style.<p/> <!--this p (paragraph) element houses my first blog post-->

            <p> This week, we are beginning to learn CSS, which is a language that describes the style of an HTML document. I have started to use CodePen which is a code editor I can use in my browser. <p/> <!--this paragraph element houses my second blog post entry-->

            <p> This week, we are pulling the style code out of the HTML and housing it in a separate external CSS file. By linking a style sheet in the beginning of my HTML code, I can tell the browser where to find the styles I have created for my blog. I have learned that there are three main ways to format the style, one is to do inline styling, the next is to do embedded style at the top of my HTML file and the third is to have an external CSS file. I also looked at a lot of really beautifully made websites that were linked on Moodle. One of my favorites was a site called magic people voodoo people which I have linked below. I think that this site is visually really pretty and there are a lot of cool motion features when you click on elements of the page. This week I found that when you search color picker on Google (which I have linked below), you can find the numerical value for any color. You can then input this number into your CSS styling code. I used the color picker to find a background color that I really liked to use for my blog. This color has the value assigned to it: #9aaece and this is used to call the specific color. I have also found CodePen very helpful. It is a website where you can write your HTML and CSS code and it simultaneously simulates what you are creating in another portion of the screen. This way, as you write your code you can see what you are doing at each step.<p/> <!--this 'p' element houses my third blog post entry-->

            <p> One of the challenges I faced this week was that the more editing I do, the more complex my code becomes and it becomes really hard to find errors. I renamed all my files to get them uniform and I managed to forget to rename the call to my external CSS file in my HTML code. It took me a long time to figure out why my CSS styles were no longer working and fix the error, but I certianly won't make this mistake again. The image to the left I found very, very relevant this week. Looking for errors in my code makes my brain explode! This week I worked on the layout of my blog, dividing up my styles with the 'div' tag and messing with the dimensions and attributes of my columns and rows. Developing the layout/ wireframe of my blog has made it much easier to read. I worked with quite a few classmates this week, and found that trying to explain things to them actually helped me to understand it all much better. One specific person I helped was Rachel Kelley. I also worked collabratively with Kaitlin. Kaitin and I compared our code and both of us have found that working on XCode has made reading our code much easier than working on TextEdit. My favorite resource to use is still <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">W3schools.com</a>. Anytime I need to search how to do something or look up a specific attribute or property, W3 schools helps to not only give me the information I need but also provide me with helpful examples of actual code. Below is a whole section where I will attach a list of other resources I have begun to work with.</p> <!--this paragraph tag houses my fourth blog post entry-->

            <p> Class Project - I am looking to create a web page that acts as a personal portfolio, kind of like an online resume. I have been working on getting a UX Internship over the summer and many applications ask for a portfolio link. I have been researching other people's online portfolios in order to get some inspiration. One really cool one I found is Cihad Turhan's personal portfolio. I have attached a link in the resources below. </p> <!--this p attibute sepererates my 2 paragraphs-->

            <p>Today in class we spend a lot of time looking at well designed sites. We saw how well developed grids and minimal color palettes can be used for a clean and beautiful page. I really enjoy looking at all sorts of websites and I am often amazed (and slightly intimidated) by the talent of so many web designers. One site I found is photographer Alexander Coggin's portfolio site (linked below). The site beautifully exhibits his photography work and combines a lot of movement and color. In particular, I think the fluid cursor is really cool and I would love to learn how to create a unique cursor like that for my project. I worked with Naomi today, and helped her with the dimensions of the columns in her CSS code. We also discussed our ideas for the project, and both of us are still in the brainstorming stage but we have some ideas. I also gave my number to Rachel, and she texted me during the week asking about the cheat sheet we attached to this post. I emailed Professor Rose and then helped clarify with Rachel since we both had a similar question about the assignment.</p>

        <p> This week we have worked on honing in on our project concept. I originally had a few ideas, the first was to make a website highlighting the artwork of a friend of mine who is an art major here at Saint Mary's. My other idea was to create a portfolio website for myself, that artistically showcases my resume and some of my skills in HTML. This week I have decided to do the portfolio, because as I more seriously think about my post-graduate plans, I have become really interested in interning over the summer as a UX Designer. I believe that having a porfolio to link on a resume will look really good to a potential employer, by not just telling them I have skills in HTML and design but by actually showing them.</p>
        <p> We also worked for the first time with Adobe Dream Weaver and GetHub. Adobe DW is a web design software that does a lot of the hard work for you, so long as you have some understanding of coding HTML and CSS, it is a great resource. GetHub is a software development platform where we will begin submitting our blog posts.</p>
